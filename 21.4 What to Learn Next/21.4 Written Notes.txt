-> once you've completed flask, it's time to explore new areas to expand your skill set  
    -> there are multiple directions you can go in, depending on your interests and career goals  

-> what to learn next:  
    -> more back-end development with django  
        -> django is another popular python web framework, offering a different approach to web development  
        -> it is considered a "boilerplate" framework, meaning it comes with a lot of built-in features ("batteries included")  
        -> django is ideal for complex projects that need to be built quickly  
        -> while django is less flexible than flask, it is very useful for rapid development  
        -> learning django is a logical next step if you're serious about web development with python  

    -> front-end web development with javascript  
        -> javascript is essential for front-end development and is widely used to create dynamic user interfaces  
        -> learning javascript can help you become a full-stack developer by complementing your flask back-end skills  
        -> improving the front-end of your projects will give you more control over the entire development process  
        -> consider the codingnomads javascript 101 course to enhance your javascript skills  

    -> data science & machine learning  
        -> flask can be used as a back-end framework for data science applications, making it a good foundation for ai-related projects  
        -> learn to present data science and machine learning models as web applications using flask  
        -> consider diving into courses related to data science & machine learning to expand your expertise  

    -> job preparation  
        -> if you're looking to start a career or freelance as a flask developer, focus on building your professional profile  
        -> consider career coaching to help you make informed decisions and prepare for the job market  
        -> building a strong portfolio and resume is essential to landing a job or contracting work as a software developer  
        -> stay engaged in the community and keep learning to enhance your employability  

-> additional resources:  
    -> codingnomads django course for learning the django framework  
    -> codingnomads javascript 101 course for a deep dive into front-end development  
    -> codingnomads data science courses to explore machine learning and ai  
    -> codingnomads career coaching for job preparation and career guidance  

-> keep up the great work, and stay in touch with the community on discord as you continue your learning journey
